Reference architecture for an enterprise agentic landscape using ServiceNow AI Agent Studio, n8n, and MCP to automate PepsiCo logistics incident resolution; presented at ServiceNow World Forum NYC 2025 during RiseUp's *"The Future of Agentic AI in Enterprise Organizations"* panel.

### PepsiCo’s job is to make sure their products, like Gatorade or Lay’s, reach retailers on time and in the right quantities. 

### Their entire business can really be summed up in one phrase I learned from Prashant Arora, Director of Strategy and Transformation at PepsiCo, during ServiceNow’s Knowledge 2025:

# ‘We plan, we make, we move, we sell.’

### Now, imagine this: a truck carrying a PepsiCo shipment to Whole Foods gets into an accident. 

### Thankfully everyone’s safe, but now the delivery process is broken. 

### Someone has to step in fast: find another route, set a new ETA, and update Whole Foods so their shelves don’t sit empty.

### Meanwhile, Schneider, our logistics partner, needs us to dispatch an alternate delivery route so that our delivery SLAs are still being met. 

### Otherwise delays can trigger substantial contract penalties and lost revenue.

## To address challenges like this, Berlynsea and I built closed-loop orchestration layers comprised of AI Agents that allows operations teams to quickly analyze the financial impact of a breakdown, identify the best rerouting options, and coordinate updates across logistics partners and retail clients in real time.

### The result? Resolution processes that are faster, smarter, and more cost-efficient. This helps everyone involved and PepsiCo can keep creating more smiles with every sip and every bite!

### It’s important to distinguish between MCP and A2A because they serve different layers of communication.

### MCP focuses on translation and context sharing between systems, while A2A focuses on how agents actually talk and collaborate.

### Together, these two layers form the backbone of agentic collaboration across PepsiCo’s infrastructure — connecting data, tools, and reasoning across every platform.

### Now, imagine connecting SAP Joule, AWS Bedrock AgentCore, and ServiceNow AIA into a single intelligent ecosystem.

### Well — we built some future-state solutions to show exactly what that could look like!
